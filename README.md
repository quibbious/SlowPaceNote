# What is This? 

I'm working on a Python project to write pace notes faster for computer games like DIRT 2.0.

# Why?

Fun little project, because why not? 

## Documentation

my dog ate my documentation.

## Installation

Download from GitHub

```cmd
pip3 install customtkinter, python-tkinter
cd (wherever you installed it)
python main.py
```
    
## What I might do in the future

- Better Look []

- ranges between paces (e.g 50, 100, 150) []

- Better button management []

- Voice Recognition []

## Optimizations

There is  a one-file DEV version (spn-dev.py). It is the "testing ground" for the roadmap. Currently, it features a newer, nicer look.

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute, do so on the contribution branch. If there's something I like, I'll add it. Currently, I need help splitting the one file into other separate files. As much as I like one file, The convenience and modularity matter more.
